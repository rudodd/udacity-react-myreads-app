# MyReads Project

The MyReads app allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## App Functionality

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books.

### The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.

The main page also has a link to '/search', a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.

## TL;DR

## To test the app:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`
